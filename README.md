The C++ Movie Ticket Booking System is a console-based application that allows users to book movie tickets conveniently. Users can register, select movies, choose seats, make payments, and view their booking history. An admin panel is available for managing movies, showtimes, and seating arrangements. 
The system prioritizes security, error handling, and data privacy while incorporating essential C++ programming concepts.
